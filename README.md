# Layouts Plugin
A small quality-of-life plugin to allow importing and exporting of UE4 layouts.

Adds "Import Layout" and "Export Layout" to Window drop-down.

**Import Layout:** Requires a restart of the editor, and loads in the new layout.
I've looked into this and unfortunately there's no way to refresh slate in the editor on all tabs without restarting the MainWindow. If anyone has any idea how to have the layout loaded without requiring an editor restart, *I'd love you forever*.

**Export Layout:** Saves out the layout to a directory and a name you specify, handy for sharing layouts with others.

**WIP:**
I'm working on adding a recent drop-down that will show previously loaded Editor Layouts, handy for quick switching.
